A bit tart on the finish, but with food this is enjoyable for its swagger.",,87,20.0,South Africa,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,The Berrio
59388,New Zealand,"This attractively priced Pinot Noir combines fruit from Nelson and Marlborough to create a fresh, snappy blend of plum and black cherry fruit. Some slightly briary-herbal notes and silky tannins add interest, smoothed out by hints of brown sugar and baking spices. Drink nowÛÒ2012.",,88,20.0,New Zealand,,,Pinot Noir,Catalina Sounds
6168,Moldova,"This 100% Feteasca Neagra has aromas of fresh strawberry and red plum. It is soft on entry into the mouth and has flavors of dried cherries, cloves and prunes.",,88,12.0,Moldova,,,Feteasca Neagra,Vinaria din Vale
128257,Bulgaria,"This refreshing ChardonnayÛÓwith aromas of grapefruit and lemon and flavors of zesty grapefruit and lemon zestÛÓis anchored by a weight that gives it balance. Overall, the wine finds a great middle ground and is food friendly.",,84,8.0,Bulgaria,,,Chardonnay,Targovishte
116551,US,"Tasted in October, 2007, the wine was mute, offering little aromatically except for teasing notes of blackberries and oak. That shyness extended to the taste, where strong, hard tannins provide an almost impenetrable coat of armor to what's inside. But right down the middle of the palate is a deep, intensely powerful stream of perfectly ripened cassis that's all the proof you need of ageability. This is a magnificently structured young wine, reminiscent of a fine young Pauillac. Best after 2012, and should have another decade after that, at least.",Insignia,97,200.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Joseph Phelps
116564,US,"It's impossible for a Cabernet to be richer, more opulent or more hedonistically stunning on opening than this beauty from veteran Phelps. Admittedly, there are significant tannins. But the wine delivers a broadside of the sweetest, ripest cassis fruit imaginable, along with richly toasted oak. It's the kind of Cab that will dazzle even an amateur. Absolutely gorgeous now, with immaculate elegance. About the only criticism you can offer is that the structure is a bit obvious, and ageability may be limited.",Backus,95,200.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Joseph Phelps
74057,US,"The former basketball star's initial release immediately establishes itself among the elite Cabernets of Napa Valley. Made from mountain vineyards on Atlas Peak and benches in the Rutherford appellation, it combines intensity with elegance. Bursts with upfront, delicious blackberry, crÌ¬me de cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wildly sweet on the midpalate, but then finish thoroughly dry. Structure comes by way of a tangy minerality and finely laced tannins. This is one of those wines that is softly decadent from start to finish, although it's probably not one to hold much beyond six years.",Family Reserve,97,625.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Yao Ming
83298,US,"Made in the Lokoya style, which is darkly colored, full bodied, tannic and dense in mountain fruit. A spicy oak tone joins with massive blackberry, cassis and violet flavors to make this wine delicious from the start. It's very tannic and needs a great deal of time. Begin to enjoy this wine in 2016, and it should go far longer than that.",,94,350.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lokoya
135895,US,"A disappointing wine. Tastes frankly unripe, with a vegetal undertow to the blackberries and cherries. The thinness of fruit accentuates the alcohol which, although only 14.6%, comes through as hot. The grapes came from the cool Coombsville area, and the wine is 100% Cabernet.",,84,225.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Meteor
118377,Argentina,"Granular, raisiny and heavy on the nose, with jammy blackberry aromas. The palate then hits with a thud; it's chunky and low in acidity, which yields a thick flavor set of prune and coffee. Better once it breathes, but it's still a bit too sticky and syrupy for our liking.",Reserva,85,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Norton
119041,Argentina,"The ÛÏoakÛ in the name is appropriate because this one is draped in unctuous, heavy, burnt aromas. The nose is a cloud of coconut, char and woody blackberry, while the syrupy palate is all sweet black plum, carob, mint and resin. Quite oaky and thick for a value-priced wine.",Vika Oak,83,12.0,Other,San Juan,,Malbec,Bodegas La Guarda
132683,Argentina,"Jammy red-fruit aromas mixed with buttery oak make for a simple, sappy nose. There's more butter on the palate in addition to solid blackberry flavors. It finishes round but short, with yet another wave of barrel. A very good wine but not one that wows.",Reserva,87,18.0,Mendoza Province,LujÌÁn de Cuyo,,Malbec,Bodega Norton
44070,Argentina,"Rubbery and warm on the nose, with earthy plum and blackberry aromas. The palate is full and bouncy, with appropriate plum, berry and cassis flavors. Nice for standard New World Cab, with fig, chocolate and no buttery, sloppy oak.",,86,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Norton
129117,Argentina,"Colorful but low in pulse, with jammy, pasty aromas sitting in front of a bulky, one-dimensional palate that offers standard blackberry fruit and mildly herbal side flavors. Has just enough acidity to keep it pumping, but as a whole it comes across a little too heavy and jammy compared to previous years.",A Lisa,85,25.0,Other,RÌ_o Negro Valley,,Malbec,Bodega NoemÌ_a de Patagonia
